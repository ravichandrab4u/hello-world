Creating a Git Repo and Checking Commands
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial load"
git remote add origin <Actual Git Repo URL(Can be Branch or Master)>
git pull origin master
git push origin master

Workflow:
Create a new Branch based on the assigned feature
Chekcout the branch and do development
After completing dev work create a pull request so that the code can be sent for review to other developers
They can review the changes and merge to there branch.
If review changes are good then merge the pull request to main branch or master 
finally delete the branch

Usually Pull requests are for merging dev changes to Master or other main branch

Merging Development branch with Master
git fetch origin master
--This line makes sure he has any upstream commits that have been made to master since the last time updated his local repository.
git merge master
--The second pulls those changes (if any) from master into development
git push origin development:master
--The third pushes the development branch (now fully merged with master) up to origin/master
